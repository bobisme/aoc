| 17  | In Rust. Dijkstra with custom priority queue made of a bin heap, hash set, and hash map for item version tracking. |          <180ms |
| 18  | Shoelace variant.                                                                                                  |           <11ms |
| 19  | p2 using interval arithmetic.                                                                                      |           <20ms |
| 20  | Both parts in rust. Uses a topological sort.                                                                       |          <150ms |
| 21  | Calculates positions using 3 odd-numbered intervals beyond width. Solves with sympy.                               |            ~13s |
| 22  | Python blender script. With visual debug tools. Pure python solution though, longer to render than solve.          |         seconds |
| 23  | Switched to Rust                                                                                                   |                 |
| 24  | Uses sympy to derive & solve p2. < 1 sec                                                                           |             <1s |
| 25  | Switched to Rust. Implemented Stoer-Wagner. Using Karger-Stein with a disjoint set for conctractions.              | varies, seconds |
