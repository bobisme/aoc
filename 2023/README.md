| 22  | Python blender script. With visual debug tools. Pure python solution though, longer to render than solve.          |         seconds |
| 23  | Switched to Rust                                                                                                   |                 |
| 24  | Uses sympy to derive & solve p2. < 1 sec                                                                           |             <1s |
| 25  | Switched to Rust. Implemented Stoer-Wagner. Using Karger-Stein with a disjoint set for conctractions.              | varies, seconds |
